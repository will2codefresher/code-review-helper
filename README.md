Our team use Intelj idea as IDE. We have been choosing spring cloud. As a result, we have over 20 repos to maintain. 
As the project goes larger and larger, daily code review preparation turns hard for us.
We have to deal with 3 most tough stuff:
1. Get the latest code.
2. Pick out the difference since last reviewed snapshot.
3. Do step 1 and 2 cross over 20 repos 

It can not be more sad for programmer to repeat that stuff over 20 times a day, 20 days a month ....

It is time to call for my code-review-helper to get us out of the suck.

On button solution to prepare you all the code to review. 

Python becomes the first that comes out from my mind. It takes me 8 hour the develop the origin and it is provided to the 
team to try. At first, it get the latest code, compare the difference and record the code review stop. 

It has become the necessary in our team and it is used over half year. And my idol tech lead encourage me to put it on git hub.
So it comes here several days after it is released. But I have not maintained it. I have no sense of open source.
I have been worked a programer for some 8 year. In the pass 6 year , I work as a embed software engineer. Exactly I have 
been written hardware driver for year.

I turned to JAVA and work as a full stack engineer from June 2017.
