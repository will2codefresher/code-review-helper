Our team use Intelj idea as IDE. We have been choosing spring cloud. As a result, we have over 20 repos to maintain. 
As the project goes larger and larger, daily code review preparation turns hard for us.
We have to deal with 3 most touch stuff:
1. Get the latest code.
2. Pick out the difference since last reviewed snapshot.
3. Do step 1 and 2 cross over 20 repos 

It can be sad for programmer to repeat that stuff over 20 per day, 20 days per month ....

It is time to call for my code-review-helper to get us out of the suck.

On button solution to prepare you all the code to review.
